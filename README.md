## Docs
Izichartz is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
Its goal is to help users with software design through a grafic tool and various design model modules. Each module is specifically developed 
for the relative design model, with effective functionalities that will help the user fastening his workflow and focusing on the design and the development, instead of wasting time with useless layout adjustments.

    ## Getting Started
    First, run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

    You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
